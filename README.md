# PolyEditor

A polyhedron generator and visualizer using [three.js](https://threejs.org/)

Mostly an excuse to learn three.js, inspired by [polyHÃ©dronisme](https://levskaya.github.io/polyhedronisme/)

## Known issues

- Visualization fails for polyhedra that have non-convex faces. Compare for example gsnC with gddsnC. This happens because my face ordering algorithm (polygonSort.js) breaks down for non-convex polygons. I don't think this can be solved by a proper convex hull, since the shape is not convex. I think my problems with incorrectly ordered edges on polyhedra faces could be solved using a more powerful data structure (winged edges or half edges?)
